# Centsible

At Centsible, we envision a world where every college student feels empowered and confident in managing their finances. By offering features such as real-time tracking of income and expenses, personalized spending insights, monthly spending trackings, and goal-setting capabilities shared with friends, 'Centsible' will transform budgeting from a daunting, boring task into a manageable and even enjoyable experience!

The phrase 'to keep it short and sweet' comes to mind. 
Other budgetting tools out there make you pay for Premium account, have overly complicated investment, track Crypto, make you subscribe for 'advanced' reportings and analytics.. all good, professional things but do college kids really need that at the present moment!? Our 'Centsible' app- which is highly centered around college kids will have all the necessary implementations 'sweet' and 'short' in a sense that we will be distinguishing the real necessities to extra add-ins that many other apps tend to have. Thus, it will be manageable and easy to work with, only focusing on what college kids might need.
