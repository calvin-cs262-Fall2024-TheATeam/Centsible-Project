# Centsible

At Centsible, we envision a world where every college student feels empowered and confident in managing their finances. By offering features such as real-time tracking of income and expenses, personalized spending insights, monthly spending trackings, and goal-setting capabilities shared with friends, Centsible will transform budgeting from a daunting, boring task into a manageable and even enjoyable experience!

The phrase 'to keep it simple, but not too simple' comes to mind. Other budgetting tools out there requires a subscription or a payment, have complicated diagrams analyzing how much you've spent, or even becomes another task for you to manage! On the other hand, Centsible is highly centered for college students, making it manageable to work with by only focusing on what you might need in user-friendly ways.

Here are the list of our main focuses. Our app will be...
- INTERACTIVE: easy and manageable, interactive and user-friendly (for ex. ability to track income & expenses.
- RESPONSIVE: goal setting & budget planning, alerts & notifications (ex., when goals are achieved, when you're about to pass the budget limit), monthly reports & diagram that shows the daily/weekly/monthly/yearly analysis of incomes and expenses.
  
By prioritizing accessibility and user experience for college students, Centsible aims to be the go-to financial companion for students, helping them achieve their budgeting goals and build a foundation for a secure financial future!
