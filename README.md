# Project

Our team will build an app with the working title of "Student Budgeting." Our goal is to create an app that makes budgeting easy and accessible for college students by tracking income, helping them understand their spending habits, and creating a budgeting system that works. Other similar budgeting apps often feature customization and bank syncing, but it can be complex and unfamiliar to the college student. Along with many standard budget app features, we will add an accountability feature where a trusted friend or family member can see when the student is going over budget. We hope that this app will be a useful first step and create a positive experience that helps them reach their budgeting goals.
