# Centsible User Testing Script

<b> Introduction </b>

Thank you for agreeing to do this usability test for our app Centsible. Centsible is a simple budgeting app where you can create a budget, organize your expenses and incomes, and see reports of your spending from the month. We are doing this test to understand what it’s like for real people to use the app, and we will use the results to improve the app. 

To be clear, we are testing the app, not you. You can’t do anything wrong here. If you run into a problem or get confused, that is a problem for us to fix. We want to hear exactly what you think about the app, and don’t worry about hurting our feelings. That will help us find the problems so that we can fix them.

For the test, we’ll ask you to do certain tasks, and we’d like you to think out loud while you’re doing them. For example, if I ask you to find a button, you can tell us where you looked first and whether you found it. If you have questions, just ask. If you have comments, go ahead and say them. We’ll record your comments, but they are only for our use and will not be public. If for any reason you would like to quit, then say “I quit” and we will end it immediately.
