# Centsible Usability Test Report

<b> Test: </b>

The usability test included the following instructions:

- Open the app and login in with the given credentials (user@example.com, password)
- Take a second to look at the home page – is it clear to you what all the elements are for?
- How much do you have left in your budget in the Food category?
- Imagine that you want to start taking the bus more often, and you want to budget $10.00 for the fare for the month. Add this to your budget.
- Identify a category that is currently over budget.
- Find a report of the expenses under the category “Food”
- Find the list of all transactions
- Find the description about the transaction of $50.00 for category “food” on October 28
- Add a transaction for an income of $50.00 that was received on November 10, 2024
- Add expense of $40.00 in category “transportation” on the current date
- Find the details of transaction you just added
- Now delete that transaction
- Turn on notifications
- Any final comments? Overall usefulness? Ability to navigate? Any minor detail you didn’t like?

The user tasks mentioned above tested out the key features of our application. The users’ immediate responses and thought process walkthroughs gave us helpful user experience insights.

<b> User Feedback: </b>

The constructive feedback/suggestions/observations received:

- The delete functionality in Transactions Tab could be hard to figure out for some users on the first try since it is not very obvious.
- Perhaps the first screen could be the Reports Tab due to the visualizations? And then the Budget tab?
- The slash between the spent amount and budgeted amount was a little confusing in the beginning. Confusion over which was the amount spent and which was the amount budgeted.
- The Budget tab says Add an Item instead of a Budget which was confusing.
- Perhaps transactions by month in the Transaction Tab since it is the case for both Budget and Reports Tab?
- Perhaps there could be a link between the budget category and reports for more intuitive access to reports?
- Automatic scroll for the Reports tab for more intuitive user experience?
- A percentage in the progress bar for Budget Tab could be helpful.
- Pie chart was clicked instead of the dropdown affordance in the Reports tab by multiple users at first.
- Didn’t like the pie chart colors.
- Error popping at the bottom of the Reports Tab

<b> Future plans: </b>

We have addressed and implemented needed changes for multiple of the feedback points from the usability tests already. Some of them are:

- The updated UI for the Budget tab has taken care of the confusion caused by the slash between the spent amount and budgeted amount.
- We have changed ‘Add an Item” to “Add a subcategory” for clarity.
- We are currently working on the automatic scroll for the Reports tab expense breakdown.
- We have implemented a percentage in the progress bar of the Budget tab.
- We have debugged the error popping up at the bottom of the Reports tab.

For the rest of the feedback points, there are some UX decisions that we are planning to stick with, and some that we will look into improving but are in the discussion phase. All in all, the usability tests have immensely aided our development process.
